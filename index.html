                <p class="j1">On 11 December 1818 Jaisalmer became a British protectorate in the Rajputana Agency.[15][14]<br>
                    Traditionally, in the Middle Ages, the main source of income for the kingdom was levies on caravans,<br> but the economy was heavily affected when Bombay emerged as a major port and sea trade replaced the traditional land routes.<br> Ranjit Singh and Bairi Sal Singh attempted to turn around the economic decline but the dramatic reduction in trade impoverished the kingdom.<br> A severe drought and the resulting famine from 1895 to 1900, during the reign of Salivahan Singh, only made matters worse by causing widespread loss of the livestock that the increasingly agriculturally based kingdom relied upon.
                    
                    The attempts of Jawahir Singh (1914–1949) at modernization were also not entirely successful in turning the kingdom's economy around, and the drylands of Jaisalmer remained backward compared with other regions of Rajputana, especially the neighbouring state of Jodhpur. <br>Nonetheless, the extensive water storage and supply, sanitation, and health infrastructures developed in the 1930s by the prime minister Brijmohan Nath Zutshi provided significant relief during the severe droughts of 1941 and 1951. <br>During 1930–1947, Jawahir Singh and his ministers also promoted technical education and the academic disciplines of civil and mechanical engineering in the state.</p>
